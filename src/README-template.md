## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [BEM](https://getbem.com/)
- [px to rem](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sainoba.px-to-rem) - VSCode snippet

### What I learned

Firstly, I've learned to use @forward and @import SASS directives instead of @import. Secondly, I've started to use package.json more reasonably and I believe this is a start of learning npm and build tools for me.
